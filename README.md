Diploma Mini project - Admission Management for College
The project entitled ADMISSION MANAGEMENT FOR COLLEGE aims at developing an online admission application for a college. 
This system is an online system that can be accessed throughout the organization and outside as well with proper login provided.
Our system has two types of accessing modes, admin login and student.
Student management system is managed by an administrator.
It is the job of the administrator to admit and monitor the whole process.
When a user logs in to the system, he/she can view and edit his/her personal information.
The system has three modules.
They are
• Admin Register
• Admin Login
• Student
Students have to fill in their details in the application form provided and they can also make changes or delete their application form even after submission.
College principal/administrator logging in may also access/search information put up by the students.
